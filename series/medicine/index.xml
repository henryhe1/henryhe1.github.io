      <description>Estimated read time: 18min.
This should go without saying, but the following opinions are mine and mine alone.

The Pandemic Situation I‚Äôve been thinking about this deeply for the past couple of days. As the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide continues to climb above 1.6 million, the number of deaths is more than 100 times the number of deaths from the 2003 SARS outbreak and more than 4 times the number of deaths from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.</description>

      <description>Estimated reading time: 10 minutes‚Ä¶ but there are pretty pictures!
I attended an online webinar the other day organized by the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE). The session was titled ‚ÄúCOVID-19 and climate change - Where do we go from here?‚Äù and consisted of a panel of speakers, including physicians and other board members of the organization. I was interested because I had heard something about carbon emissions dropping ever since people have been staying home and the economy had been slowing down.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;#7 changed my LIFE!! Lol
Starting med school has been simultaneously the most exciting and the most overwhelming time of my life. It‚Äôs only been a month, and I already feel a lot of the responsibilities of ‚Äúbeing a doctor‚Äù. Like Shakespeare wrote in Twelfth Night, it‚Äôs kind of been thrust upon me, all of a sudden. Starting the Problem Based Learning (PBL) model here at Mac was a little analogous to being thrown into the deep end, where at least before there were familiar creatures like marked exams and projects‚Äîhave now been replaced by a void of vague tutorial objectives, optional anatomy labs, and ‚Äúprofessional competency‚Äù.</description>
